The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.The Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.Trips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.The daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.These data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.",

Prior to the TSAs, the magnitude of transportation services had long been underestimated, as most national measures counted only the value of for-hire services. Measurement of services provided only by for-hire firms misses the sizable contribution of transportation services that take place within nontransportation industries, termed as in-house transportation.To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs, as a supplement to the U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, measure the contribution of both for-hire and in-house transportation. The TSAs include all seven of the for-hire transportation industries reported in the U.S. I-O accounts and four in-house transportation modes.",

Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA’s MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army’s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD. Further documentation can be found here: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1038.",

The passenger index is a statistical estimate of airline passenger travel and other components based on historical trends up to December 2019. As a result, the estimates have yet to fully account for the impact of the coronavirus. Air freight is also a statistical estimate. Since air freight makes up a smaller part of the freight index, the freight TSI is being released as scheduled.DescriptionStatisticians use the process of seasonal-adjustment to uncover trends in data. Monthly data, for instance, are influenced by the number of days and the number of weekends in a month as well as by the timing of holidays and seasonal activity. These influences make it difficult to see underlying changes in the data. Statisticians use seasonal adjustment to control for these influences.Controlling of seasonal influences allows measurement of real monthly changes; short and long term patterns of growth or decline; and turning points. Data for one month can be compared to data for any other month in the series and the data series can be ranked to find high and low points. Any observed differences are “real” differences; that is, they are differences brought about by changes in the data and not brought about by a change in the number of days or weekends in the month, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a holiday, or seasonal activity.",

MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation.A BSM is one of the messages belonging to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2735 Standard. This standard is geared toward supporting the interoperability of DSRC applications through the use of a standardized message set and its data frames and data elements. A BSM, which is at times referred to as a “heartbeat” message, is a frequently transmitted message (usually at approximately 10Hz) that is meant to increase a vehicle’s situational awareness. These messages are intended to be used for a variety of applications to exchange safety data regarding a vehicle’s state.A typical BSM contains up to two parts. Part I, the binary large object (blob), is included in every BSM. It contains the fundamental data elements that describe a vehicle’s position (latitude, longitude, elevation) and motion (heading, speed, acceleration). Part II of a BSM contains optional data that is transmitted when required or in response to an event. Typically Part II contains data that serves as an extension of vehicle safety information (path history, path prediction, event flags) and data pertaining to the status of a vehicle’s components, such as lights, wipers, and brakes. NOTE: All extra attachments are located in Multi-Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal Systems Basic Safety Messages such as MAP, Detectors, and Simulation results",

A continuously updating archive of the WZDx feed data can be found at ITS WorkZone Data Sandbox.  The live feed is currently compliant with WZDx specification version 3.0.",

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.The Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.Trips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.The daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.These data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.",

Prior to the TSAs, the magnitude of transportation services had long been underestimated, as most national measures counted only the value of for-hire services. Measurement of services provided only by for-hire firms misses the sizable contribution of transportation services that take place within nontransportation industries, termed as in-house transportation.To more accurately measure transportation services, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, jointly developed the Transportation Satellite Accounts (TSAs). The TSAs, as a supplement to the U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Accounts, measure the contribution of both for-hire and in-house transportation. The TSAs include all seven of the for-hire transportation industries reported in the U.S. I-O accounts and four in-house transportation modes.",

The Federal Highway Administration’s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA’s MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army’s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD. Further documentation can be found here: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1038.",

The passenger index is a statistical estimate of airline passenger travel and other components based on historical trends up to December 2019. As a result, the estimates have yet to fully account for the impact of the coronavirus. Air freight is also a statistical estimate. Since air freight makes up a smaller part of the freight index, the freight TSI is being released as scheduled.DescriptionStatisticians use the process of seasonal-adjustment to uncover trends in data. Monthly data, for instance, are influenced by the number of days and the number of weekends in a month as well as by the timing of holidays and seasonal activity. These influences make it difficult to see underlying changes in the data. Statisticians use seasonal adjustment to control for these influences.Controlling of seasonal influences allows measurement of real monthly changes; short and long term patterns of growth or decline; and turning points. Data for one month can be compared to data for any other month in the series and the data series can be ranked to find high and low points. Any observed differences are “real” differences; that is, they are differences brought about by changes in the data and not brought about by a change in the number of days or weekends in the month, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a holiday, or seasonal activity.",

MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation.A BSM is one of the messages belonging to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2735 Standard. This standard is geared toward supporting the interoperability of DSRC applications through the use of a standardized message set and its data frames and data elements. A BSM, which is at times referred to as a “heartbeat” message, is a frequently transmitted message (usually at approximately 10Hz) that is meant to increase a vehicle’s situational awareness. These messages are intended to be used for a variety of applications to exchange safety data regarding a vehicle’s state.A typical BSM contains up to two parts. Part I, the binary large object (blob), is included in every BSM. It contains the fundamental data elements that describe a vehicle’s position (latitude, longitude, elevation) and motion (heading, speed, acceleration). Part II of a BSM contains optional data that is transmitted when required or in response to an event. Typically Part II contains data that serves as an extension of vehicle safety information (path history, path prediction, event flags) and data pertaining to the status of a vehicle’s components, such as lights, wipers, and brakes. NOTE: All extra attachments are located in Multi-Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal Systems Basic Safety Messages such as MAP, Detectors, and Simulation results",

Data designed to show the impacts of COVID-19 on bikeshare ridership as featured at https://maps.dot.gov/BTS/dockedbikeshare-COVID/Ridership data not available for all docked bikeshare systems. Only docked bikeshare systems with ridership data shown. Some systems included in the data permit users to leave a bicycle outside of a docking station; these trips are not counted. Trips defined as rides from point A to B. If user makes trip from B to A on same day, counted as a second trip. Trips labeled as round trips in Metro Bike Share and Indego trip files counted as 2 trips. Trips with no trip time are not counted.

The messages that returned per a query submission communicates a pertinent advisor message which is in part contextualized by location and content.NOTE: All Extra Files are attached in 2014 ITS World Congress Connected Vehicle Test Bed Demonstration Vehicle Situation Data",
