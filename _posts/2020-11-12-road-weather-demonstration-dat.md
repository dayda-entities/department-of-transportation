However, within the data file provided as part of this data environment, only data during the World Congress demonstration period from September 5, 2014 to September 11, 2014 is included.  Several vehicles equipped with multiple sensors drove around the island collecting 572,030 readings of multiple variables. The uploaded data file lists all those observations and the pertaining details about the sensor equipment, the sensor platform and the status of quality checking performed for each observation.
