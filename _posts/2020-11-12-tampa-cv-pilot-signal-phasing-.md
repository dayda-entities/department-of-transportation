The Tampa CV Pilot generates  data from the interaction between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. This dataset consists of Signal Phasing and Timing Message (SPaT) Messages transmitted by road-side units (RSU) located throughout the Tampa CV Pilot Study area. The full set of raw, SPaT data from Tampa CV Pilot can be found in the <a href="http://usdot-its-cvpilot-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank" >ITS Sandbox</a>. The data fields follow SAE J2735 data frames (Section 6) and structure (Section 7).

This dataset holds a flattened sample of the SPaT data from Tampa CV Pilot. A column of random numbers (randomNum) was added to allow for random sampling of data points within Socrata.
