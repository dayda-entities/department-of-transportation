During the 2014 ITS World Congress a demonstration of the connected vehicle infrastructure in the City of Detroit was conducted.  The test site included approximately 14 intersections around Detroitâ€™s COBO convention center and involved 9 equipped vehicles. Traveler Situation Data (TSD) was obtained from the data warehouse, and not the data clearinghouse. Only 19 messages were obtained from our query as the current mode of operation of the Test Bed is that the warehouse only contains a few static messages, which are meant to serve as a proxy for future operation in which query submissions will only return message(s) relevant to the context in which the query was submitted. The messages that returned per a query submission communicates a pertinent advisor message which is in part contextualized by location and content.
