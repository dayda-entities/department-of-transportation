During the 2014 ITS World Congress a demonstration of the connected vehicle infrastructure in the City of Detroit was conducted.  The test site included approximately 14 intersections around Detroitâ€™s COBO convention center and involved 9 equipped vehicles. The Vehicle Situation Data (VSD) data set includes a series of data files that recorded vehicle situational data that were generated by an equipped vehicle. During the ITS World Congress, VSDs were encoded with one of two schemas. The dataset contains decoded data using both 2.0 and 2.1 ASN.1 schemas.
