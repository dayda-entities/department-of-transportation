The WZDx Specification enables infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available for third party use. The intent is to make travel on public roads safer and more efficient through ubiquitous access to data on work zone activity. Specifically, the project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers navigate more safely.

MCDOT leads the effort to aggregate and collect work zone data from the AZTech Regional Partners. A continuously updating archive of the WZDx feed data can be found at <a href="http://usdot-its-workzone-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITS WorkZone Data Sandbox</a>.  The live feed is currently compliant with <a href="https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-wzdx/tree/v1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WZDx specification version 1.1</a>.
