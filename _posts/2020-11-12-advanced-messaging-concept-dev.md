Contains all Basic Mobility Messages (BMMs) collected during the Advanced Messaging Concept Development (AMCD) field testing program. While there is no specific standard in existence that addresses the content of a BMM, the descriptive definitions of the variables were derived from the J2735 standard where applicable. All BMMs are generated by OBUs and ultimately received by the VCC Cloud server.
