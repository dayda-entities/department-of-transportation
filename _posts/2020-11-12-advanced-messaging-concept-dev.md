Contains all PDCMs generated during the AMCD field testing program. The PDCM is a control message sent from the server to OBUs to customize a request for Probe Vehicle Data (PVD) from the receiving OBU. All PDCMs are generated by the VCC Cloud server and transmitted to OBU clients through either a DSRC or cellular communications channel.
