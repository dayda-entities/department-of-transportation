Contains all Basic Mobility Control Message (BMCMs) generated during the Advanced Messaging Concept Development (AMCD) field testing program. While there is no specific standard in existence that addresses the content of a BMCM, the following format was derived to control the configuration and content of BMMs requested from the vehicle. All BMCMs are generated by the VCC Cloud server and transmitted to OBU clients through either a DSRC or cellular communications channel.
