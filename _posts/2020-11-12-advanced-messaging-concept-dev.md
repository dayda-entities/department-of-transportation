Contains all Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) collected during the Advanced Messaging Concept Development (AMCD) field testing program. For this project, all of the Part I BSM message fields were populated. Additional data fields were also added to the row to identify sender, time of communication, mode of communication, etc., allowing the consumer of this data set to accurately track messages through the system. All BSMs are generated by OBUs and ultimately received by the VCC Cloud server.
