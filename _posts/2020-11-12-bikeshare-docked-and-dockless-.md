List of cities served by a bikeshare (docked or dockless) and/or e-scooter system by month in 2020. Some systems serve more than one city. The layer lists just the primary city served. Bikeshare includes systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike) as well as dockless systems. The layer includes a count of the number of docking stations, the number of dockless bikeshare systems, and the number of e-scooter systems serving a city (if applicable) in each month and the status of the system - whether temporarily suspended or closed. Many systems temporarily suspended operations and/or closed permanently in response to COVID-19.
