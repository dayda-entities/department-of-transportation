Data is from the small-scale demonstration of the Intelligent Network Flow Optimization (INFLO) Prototype System and applications in Seattle, Washington. Connected vehicle systems were deployed in 21 vehicles in a scripted driving scenario circuiting this I-5 corridor northbound and southbound during morning rush hour. Basic Safety Messages (BSM) sent by connected vehicles (CVs) through either the cellular network or Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) when the vehicle is in the range of Roadside Units (RSU). These messages were received by the traffic management center (TMC).
