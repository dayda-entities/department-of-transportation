Data is from the small-scale demonstration of the Intelligent Network Flow Optimization (INFLO) Prototype System and applications in Seattle, Washington. Connected vehicle systems were deployed in 21 vehicles in a scripted driving scenario circuiting this I-5 corridor northbound and southbound during morning rush hour. This data set contains queue warning messages that were recommended by the INFLO Q-WARN algorithm and sent by the traffic management center to vehicles to warn drivers upstream of the queue. The objective of queue warning is to provide a vehicle operator sufficient warning of impending queue backup in order to brake safely, change lanes, or modify route such that secondary collisions can be minimized or even eliminated.
