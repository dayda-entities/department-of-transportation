Data is from the small-scale demonstration of the Intelligent Network Flow Optimization (INFLO) Prototype System and applications in Seattle, Washington. Connected vehicle systems were deployed in 21 vehicles in a scripted driving scenario circuiting this I-5 corridor northbound and southbound during morning rush hour. This data set contains real-time volume, speed and loop occupancy data that were collected from WSDOTâ€™s simulated roadway sensors every 20 seconds and aggregated according to user defined procedures and threshold by the Infrastructure Traffic Sensor System (TSS) Data Aggregator software.
