Data were collected during the Multi-Modal Intelligent Transportation Signal Systems (MMITSS) study. MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation. The GPS data set catalogs the vehicle operation data of the test vehicles that used for the MMITSS field testing. The data contains the performance and operation details of vehicles. This file contains a number of fields detailing elements such as vehicle position and speed, fidelity measures of GPS-based data elements, and vehicle operation data.
