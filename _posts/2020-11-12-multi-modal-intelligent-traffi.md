Data were collected during the Multi-Modal Intelligent Transportation Signal Systems (MMITSS) study. MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation. The Vehicle Trajectories file is populated with basic safety messages received from equipped vehicle within the communication range of an Roadside Equipment (RSEs).  The data also contains elements that communicate additional details about the vehicle that is used for vehicle safety applications, and elements that communicate specific items of a vehicleâ€˜s status that are used in data event snapshots which are gathered and periodically reported to an RSEs. These data are transmitted at a rate of 10 Hz.
