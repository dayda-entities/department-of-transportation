Information from the public to ascertain the current frequency and characteristics of bicyclist and pedestrian activity, and identify deterrents to bicycling and walking. The data will also be compared to data collected by a previous NHTSA survey, conducted in 2002, to determine if major changes have occurred over that 10-year span. The information will be used to help update and refine safety programs. A national telephone survey will be administered to 9,000 randomly selected respondents 16 and older drawn from all 50 States and the District of Columbia. The survey will ask about the characteristics of bicycling and walking trips, conspicuity, community design for bicycling and walking, bicycle helmet use, and general opinions about bicycling and walking. Interview length will average 20 minutes.
