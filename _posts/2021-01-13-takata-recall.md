Tens of millions of vehicles with Takata air bags are under recall. Long-term exposure to high heat and humidity can cause these air bags to explode when deployed. Such explosions have caused injuries and deaths. 

NHTSA urges vehicle owners to take a few simple steps to protect themselves and others from this very serious threat to safety.

This dataset tracks various progress indicators for the recall.
