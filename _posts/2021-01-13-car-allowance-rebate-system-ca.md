The Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), otherwise known as Cash for Clunkers, was a program intended to provide economic incentives to United States residents to purchase a new and more fuel efficient vehicle when trading in a less full efficient vehicle. The program was promoted as providing stimulus to the economy by boosting auto sales, while putting safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient vehicles on the road.
