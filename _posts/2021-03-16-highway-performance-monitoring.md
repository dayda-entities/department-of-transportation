The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has been receiving Highway inventory, usage, condition and performance data from State Departments of Transportation (DOT) since 1978 to support the program mission of the FHWA. Specifically, HPMS consists of detailed road segment data (63 Attributes) for higher order systems. Sample attributes for collector systems and summary data for the local roads.
New requirements for HPMS took effect in 2014 that required each State DOTs to expand their Linear Referencing Systems (LRS), a statewide geospatial representation of their road system that includes all public roads. This requirement was put in place to support highway safety.
States DOTs submit HPMS data annually to the FHWA following a prescribed format outlined in the Highway Performance Monitoring System Field Manual.
