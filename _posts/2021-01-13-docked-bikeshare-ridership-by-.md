Bikeshare ridership by system, year, month, and day for bikeshare systems with docking stations. Data available for 2020 and corresponding days of weeks in 2019. Data designed to show the impacts of COVID-19 on bikeshare ridership in 2020 relative to 2019. Ridership data not available for all docked bikeshare systems. Only docked bikeshare systems with ridership data included, and only trips ending at a docking station counted. Some of the systems included permit users to leave a bicycle outside of a docking station; these trips are not counted. Trips with no trip time and/or end station id not counted in totals. Trips shorter than 1 minute or greater than 2 hours excluded.  Trips labeled as round trips in Metro Bike Share and Indego trip files counted as 2 trips.
