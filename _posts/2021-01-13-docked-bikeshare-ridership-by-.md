Bikeshare ridership by system, year, and month for bikeshare systems with docking stations.  Data available for 2020 and corresponding days of weeks in 2019. Data designed to show the impacts of COVID-19 on bikeshare ridership in 2020 relative to 2019. 

Ridership data not available for all docked bikeshare systems. Only docked bikeshare systems with ridership data shown, and only trips ending at a docking station counted. Some systems included in the data permit users to leave a bicycle outside of a docking station; these trips are not counted. Trips defined as rides from point A to B and summarized by end station in map (e.g., count of all trips ending at station B). If user makes trip from B to A on same day, counted as a second trip. Trips labeled as round trips in Metro Bike Share and Indego trip files counted as 2 trips. Trips with no trip time and/or end station id not counted in totals. Trips shorter than 1 minute or greater than 2 hours excluded. Days aligned to include the same days of weeks in 2019 and 2020. Days included in each month are as follows: 

Jan 2019 (01/02/19 through 02/02/19); Jan 2020 (01/01/20 through 02/01/20)
Feb 2019 (02/03/19 through 03/02/19); Feb 2020 (02/02/20 through 02/29/20)
Mar 2019 (03/03/19 through 03/30/19); Mar 2020 (03/01/20 through 03/28/20)
Apr 2019 (03/31/19 through 05/04/19); Apr 2020 (03/29/20 through 05/02/20)
May 2019 (05/05/19 through 06/01/19); May 2020 (05/03/20 through 05/30/20)

Trips beginning on 12/31/2019 but ending on 01/01/2020 not included in totals.
