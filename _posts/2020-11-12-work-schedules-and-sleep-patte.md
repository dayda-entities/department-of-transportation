The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) sponsored a study of the work schedules and sleep patterns of railroad employees. The purpose of the study was to understand work-schedule related fatigue that affects various categories of railroad employees by documenting a group's work/rest schedules and sleep patterns to ascertain their impact on the level of fatigue/alertness.Employees surveyed include: signalmen, maintenance of way (MOW) workers, dispatchers, and train & engine service workers (in both freight and passenger train service)
