The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Border Crossing Data provide summary statistics for inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level.  Data are available for trucks, trains, containers, buses, personal vehicles, passengers, and pedestrians.  Border crossing data are collected at ports of entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The data reflect the number of vehicles, containers, passengers or pedestrians entering the United States.  CBP does not collect comparable data on outbound crossings.  Users seeking data on outbound counts may therefore want to review data from individual bridge operators, border state governments, or the Mexican and Canadian governments.
