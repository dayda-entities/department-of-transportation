During the 2014 ITS World Congress a demonstration of the connected vehicle infrastructure in the City of Detroit was conducted.  The test site included approximately 14 intersections around Detroit’s COBO convention center and involved 9 equipped vehicles.Intersection Situation Data (ISD) data set communicates MAP and signal phase and timing (SPaT) information. MAP information communicates an intersection’s location (latitude and longitude), elevation, and geometric features such as approaches and lane configuration. SPaT data communicates the (current) state of the intersection’s signal indication(s). The data is composed of discrete Row Groups. A Row Group is a collection of (approximately 3-4) consecutive rows with common attribute.
