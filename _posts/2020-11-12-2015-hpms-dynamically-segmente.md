The Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) compiles data on highway network extent, use, condition, and performance.  The system consists of a geospatially‚Äêenabled database that is used to generate reports and provides tools for data analysis.  Information from HPMS is used by many stakeholders across the US DOT, the Administration, Congress, and the transportation community.
