This set of data files was acquired under USDOT FHWA cooperative agreement DTFH61-11-H-00025 as one of the four test data sets acquired by the USDOT Data Capture and Management program. This is the primary loop detector data table. It contains one-minute volume, occupancy, and data quality flags for the arterial loop detector data.
