The Location Affordability Index is an indicator of housing and transportation costs at the neighborhood level.  It gives the percentage of a given family's income estimated to be spent on housing and transportation costs in a given location for eight different household profiles.  It is calculated using actual and modeled data for Census block groups in all 942 Combined Base Statistical Areas, which cover 94% of the U.S. population.
