An Opportunity Zone is an economically distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. The Department of Transportation has identified transportation assets that fall within Opportunity Zones with the goal of driving investment of all types to these important areas. This dataset identifies Amtrak Stations in Opportunity Zones, and Amtrak Stations within a quarter-mile and half-mile of Opportunity Zones.
