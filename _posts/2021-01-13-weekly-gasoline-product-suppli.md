This dataset offers insight on weekly fluctuation of the gasoline product supply, which is an important part of any analysis of construction trends, materials and operating costs associated with highway repair and construction, and changes in traffic volume. These data come directly from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) website. The EIA publishes the average daily amount of gasoline supplied in barrels, which HPPI converts to an average number of gallons of gasoline per week.
