Data is from the small-scale demonstration of the Intelligent Network Flow Optimization (INFLO) Prototype System and applications in Seattle, Washington. Connected vehicle systems were deployed in 21 vehicles in a scripted driving scenario circuiting this I-5 corridor northbound and southbound during morning rush hour. This data set contains speed harmonization messages that were recommended by the INFLO SPD-HARM algorithm and sent by the traffic management center to the connected vehicles, which provided drivers with the suggested speed while driving on the segment of I-5 that was included in the test.  The objective of speed harmonization is to dynamically adjust and coordinate maximum appropriate vehicle speeds in response to downstream congestion, incidents, and weather or road conditions in order to maximize traffic throughput and reduce crashes.
