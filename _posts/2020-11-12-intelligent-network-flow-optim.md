Data is from the small-scale demonstration of the Intelligent Network Flow Optimization (INFLO) Prototype System and applications in Seattle, Washington. Connected vehicle systems were deployed in 21 vehicles in a scripted driving scenario circuiting this I-5 corridor northbound and southbound during morning rush hour. This data set contains real-time volume, speed and loop occupancy data that were collected from WSDOT’s simulated roadway sensors every 20 seconds and aggregated according to user defined procedures and threshold by the Infrastructure Traffic Sensor System (TSS) Data Aggregator software.
