The data in this repository were collected from the San Diego, California testbed, namely, I-15 from the interchange with SR-78 in the north to the interchange with SR-163 in the south, along the mainline and at the entrance ramps.  This file contains information on the field observation and simulation results for speed profile from the Dallas, Texas testbed. The time reported for the speed profiles are between 2:00PM to 8:00PM in increments of 10 minutes.
