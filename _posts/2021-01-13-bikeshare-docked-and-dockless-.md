The bikeshare and e-scooter layer is current as of August 1, 2020. It is a list of cities served by a bikeshare and/or e-scooter system in each year from 2015 to 2020. Some systems serve more than one city. The layer lists just the primary city served. Bikeshare includes systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike) as well as dockless systems. The layer includes a count of the number of docking stations, the number of dockless bikeshare systems, and the number of e-scooter systems serving a city (if applicable) in each year. Counts are for 12/31 of the year except 2020 which is as of 08/31/2020.
